The extension adds a request tracking system, which customers can use to file requests to the Plesk administrator. The administrator can comment on request tickets and close them.

The following techniques are demonstrated:
* Creation of a web interface for an extension.
* Addition of buttons for the administrator and customers.
* Rendering of different interfaces for the administrator and customers.
* The use of the post-install script.
* The use of an SQLite database for storing information.
